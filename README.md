## Description

Are you a film buff and you need some inspiration? ðŸŽ¬ Looking for that film that makes your hairs stand on ends or gives you butterflies in your stomach? ðŸ¦‹ The Video Store will provide you with a selection of those most popular movies. You can rent, rate the movies or simply just browse for ideas... ðŸ’¡



## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- **Homepage** => it will include all the links to navigate around the app and the 'Enter' button which will direct the user to the 'Film Selection' page.
- **Film Selection** => this page will include the selection of movies. Offering the user the chance to browse and rate the selection of movies and feel inspired. 
- **FAQ** => Everything you would like to know about the Video Store.
- **Sign Up** => A registration for new users, with both email and password validation.
- **Login** => A form for signed up users with email and password validation.

## Backlog

- More strict password validation.
- Add more details about each film and special effects on the Movie Selector page.
- Add speech bubbles on the main page.
